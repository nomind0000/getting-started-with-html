  <title>NoMind's Notes on Lesson 1, Stage 0</title>
  <!NoMind is not my real name. You can call me Jim.>
<h2> <b>What is the web?</b></h2>
  <p> The web is a set of <em>hypertext markup language (html</em>) files, the servers upon which they reside, and the network of individual computers to which the servers connect using the http protocol. The pages are identified by URLs and are joined by hyperlinks.</p>
<h2> <b>What is html?</b></h2>
   <p> HTML is the coding language that creates, collects, and formats the content of pages on the web. It produces text content, "markup," i.e., what it looks like, and hyperlinks to other web pages.</p>
<h2> <b>What else have we learned about coding HTML in the first lesson? </b></h2>
<h3><b>TAGS, Elements, and Attributes?</h3></b>
  <p>It seems that <em>tags</em> are really important, controlling formatting, importing content, and identifying textual content. A tag is recognized by angled brackets ("less than" and "greater than")that surround it. An <em>element</em> comprises an <em>opening tag</em>, a <em>closing tag</em>, and the <em>content</em> between them. An <em>attribute</em> is a property of a tag that has a <em>value.</em> Consider, for example, the expression below:<br>
<p><font color="red">&lt;a href="codepen.io/NoMind/pen/VYJRVK"> NoMind's first web page is here!&lt;/a></font><p>
<p>The expression as a whole is an element with an opening anchor tag, which includes the href attribute that specifies a hyperlink; the content, that is, the expression that appears to the reader as a hyperlink; and a closing anchor tag, &lt;/a>. This is what the reader sees:</p>
<p><a href="codepen.io/NoMind/pen/VYJRVK"> NoMind's first web page is here!</a></p> 
You can insert a photo of NoMind using html. The &lt;img> tag, referred to as a "VOID" tag because it has an opening by no closing tag, makes this easy to do. Using the src (for source) attribute, which has the</p>
<img src="http://www.threestooges.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CurlyHoward.jpg"> <h4>NoMind</h4> </p> 
<p>
  value of the URL where the photo can be found, brings the photo to your page. Of course, there may be no such page, so it is wise to take the precaution of including a message, using the "alt," for alternative attribute This may produce something like this:</p>
<font color="purple"><img scr="http://www.threestooges.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NoMind.jpg" alt="THIS DOES NOT COMPUTE. THIS DOES NOT COMPUTE. PREPARE SELF-IMMOLATION PROTOCOL. IMMOLATION BEGINS IN 30 SECONDS."<br>

</font><p>Where were we? Oh, yes--TAGS. Of tags there are two important species. One is referred to as <em>inline</em> and operates on a single line of code within which it is embedded.
  <font size="-2"><font color="green">(I think that is what it means! That is not exactly what the instructor said, but I think it is at least consistent with what he said.)</font></font></p>
  The other species is a <em>block</em>, which defines a rectangular box around the content. 
 <br>
 <br>
  Inline tags such as &lt;b>,&lt;span>,and &lt;img>
  seem to be more common, at least at stage zero than block tags such as &lt;p> and &lt;div>. The notion of a defined block is easily understood by visualizing a box around a paragraph of text defined by &lt;p>.</p>
<p>
That covers what NoMind's little brain could absorb from lesson 1. He had better stop now, as he is still about a week behind his cohort.</p>
